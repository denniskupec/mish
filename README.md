# mish
Randomly renames all files in a selected folder.

**How To Use**  
`./mish <directory>`

Every file in that directory will be renamed to some random string. 
File extensions are preserved. 

Created this since Apple's new Photos application cant shuffle slideshows and I don't want to keep a seperate iPhoto library only for that functionality.

Use Finder to sort the files by name, then open up quick view fullscreen and *viola*, you've added basic functionality to your $2000 laptop.
